Solar radiative forcing from the CMIP6 dataset - TURNED OFF - EEM 10/17/22,,
Sources:,SOLARIS HEPPA v3.2 1850-2300 transient and 1850-1873 mean datasets,
,solarisheppa.geomar.de/news,
Method:,Take annual mean of total solar irradiance in transient dataset and subtract the 1850-1873 period mean.,
,Multiply this quantity by 0.25 * 0.7 (planetary view factor * planetary co-albedo).,
,Years prior to 1850 revert to the IPCC Annex II solar forcing. Years after 2300 set to zero.,
